<BODY>The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board has started the exercise of setting up temporary shelters in areas with high concentration of the homeless. DUSIB member-expert Bipin Rai said 50 high-quality fireproof tents were being set up this year, apart from 198 permanent shelters—83 buildings and 115 porta-cabins—for the city’s poor who don’t have a roof over their heads. These shelters will have mattresses, blankets and pillows, which will be washed and replaced every few days.

According to a 2014 survey, Delhi has an estimated 16,760 homeless; the UNDP puts their number at 55,955 and the 2011 census had found 46,724 homeless people in the capital. The civil society, however, believes about 1% of the city’s population lives on the streets and under flyovers.
